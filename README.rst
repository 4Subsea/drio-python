DataReservoir.io
================

The Python API for `DataReservoir.io`_ - ``datareservoirio`` comes with all
batteries included. It provides both convinient high-level and low-level
access.

We built the Python experience with engineers and data scientists in mind. 
Because we believe insight arise when engineers are empowered with the right
data at the right time, and in the right manner. In fact, ``datareservoirio`` is
best friends with the rich Python scientific
ecosystem! It works natively with `Pandas`_ objects, and thus a perfect match
if you work with `Numpy`_, `SciPy`_, `Matplotlib`_, `scikit-learn`_, and many
more!

``datareservoirio`` is also a comprehensive library that can be used to
build other apps and services. The path from experimentation to apps and
services got a little bit shorter!
